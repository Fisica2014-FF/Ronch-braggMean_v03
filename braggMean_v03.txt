---- Modify v02 and use STL ----

Replace native arrays with STL "vectors" in the classes "Event" and 
"BraggStatistic", as described in the following.

***
Modify the class "Event":
- replace the array of energies with a std::vector ,
- remove the number of points, corresponding to the size of the vector,
- modify the member functions to use the vector in place of the native array.
In the constructor reserve for the vector a number of elements equal to 
the max number of points.

***
Modify the class "BraggStatistic":
- replace the two arrays for sum of energies and squares for all points
  with two std::vector ,
- replace the two arrays for mean and rms energies for all points
  with two other std::vector ,
- modify the member functions to use the vectors in place of the native arrays,
  return a reference-to-const from the functions "eMean" and "eRMS" .
In the constructor dimension all the vectors at the min number of points, 
with initial values 0 for the elements.

***
Modify the "main" function to get mean and rms energies as vectors in place 
of native arrays. Use a std::string for the input file name.
